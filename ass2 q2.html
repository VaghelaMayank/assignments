          Nature is all the plants, animals, and stuff outside like mountains and oceans.
          It's really beautiful and important for life.
          Trees give air to breathe, and rivers give water to drink.
          Plus, being in nature makes a lot of people feel good and calm.
          So, taking care of nature is really important.
